Just a few friends doing what they can to fight repetitive strain injury with their non-patented Break Method -- an Evolution of the Pomodoro Technique.

In addition to installing these mods, we take a 10 minute break every thirty minutes. This reliably leaves us with ~2.5 hours to prog, and a solid 30-40 mins of breaks to keep our hands -- and minds -- in supple shape for the long grind ahead. Most importantly, we're here to have fun and not steal mods.
